        "There are many components that have been created through the mResearch project and this tutorial seeks to bring most of them together through a unified example of stress classification.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For the purposes of this example, we utilize a publicly available dataset, [WESAD](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD+%28Wearable+Stress+and+Affect+Detection%29), which contains the necessary ECG and PPG data along with labeled stress and non-stress time blocks.  We will utilize the [Cerebral Cortex](https://github.com/MD2Korg/CerebralCortex-Kernel/) platform to perform the initial data ingestion and signal cleaning as well as use the platform as an data storage system for the other components. Cerebral Cortex will demonstrate its computation and algorithm capabilities along with some basic data visualizations to help you understand the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we will move in the [mFlow](https://github.com/mlds-lab/mFlow) system will be used to run a range of experimental workflows that focus on test/train or cross-validation performance of several stress clasifiers when run against the WESAD data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "To further augment the capabililites of the mResearch project, the [BioGen LINK REQUIRED]() components allows signals to be generated (e.g. ECG from PPG or PPG from ECG).  We will utilize this to transform and generate new signal from the existing WESAD data.  The mFlow system will be utilized to compare the performance of the modeling system as well as the performance of the BioGen data generators.\n",

The following sensor modalities are included: blood volume pulse, electrocardiogram, electrodermal activity, electromyogram, respiration, body temperature, and three-axis acceleration. Moreover, the dataset bridges the gap between previous lab studies on stress and emotions, by containing three different affective states (neutral, stress, amusement). In addition, self-reports of the subjects, which were obtained using several established questionnaires, are contained in the dataset. "
